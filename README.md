This project is aimed at creating an automated plant robot for the sustainable growth and development of the plant. In this project, we place a plant on a mobile platform equipped with a variety of sensors and use a Raspberry Pi to read sensor data and provide the required outputs for creating the optimum environment for the plant. The mobile platform is set to move in the direction of more sunlight and pump out stagnant water in the pot when its reaches 1 inch. It is also programmed to send a mail to the user if the temperature is more than the plant's tolerable limit.
